While there isn't a straightforward yes or no answer, I can help break down the concept for you. 

Some architects might weave in subtle designs or patterns that could be seen as messages or codes, but it's not like these are always intended to convey secret information. Think of it more as a playful touch or an artistic expression. On the flip side, some theories and speculations suggest that certain architectural designs might be laced with hidden meanings or codes that could point to larger mysteries or intentions.

So, while there's no concrete evidence that modern architecture is riddled with secret codes, it's intriguing to think about the creative ways architects might sneak in these details. And who knows, maybe there's a hidden world of messages waiting to be uncovered! The beauty of this topic is that it sparks our imagination and curiosity, inviting us to explore the intersection of art and architecture. I hope this helps you continue the conversation with your friends and maybe even fuels your curiosity about what might be hiding in plain sight.
